:mortar_board: I recently graduated from a general engineering school, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

My first IT projects were developed in C# on Visual Studio, in 2018.

:art: Then I learned to develop Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): in Python with a Paint application and the GO game, but also in C#/XAML with a WPF interface for a a food order management tool.

:bulb: Finally I discovered various fields of application of Artificial Intelligence through several projects from 2020: AI that plays Connect 4 game, k-nearest neighbors algorithm...

:telescope: I am now particularly interested in the applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
